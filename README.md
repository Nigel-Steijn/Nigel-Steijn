### Experience

I started programming at the age of 12 in 2012 and began my professional journey in 2018. Over the years, 
I've primarily worked on closed-source projects, focusing on office automation, logistics and financial systems. 
In the early days, I also delved into hardware programming, which was a fascinating experience and I'd love to improve myself further with.
