### Experience
I started programming at the age of 12 in 2012 and began my professional journey in 2018. Over the years, I've primarily worked on closed-source projects, focusing on office automation and logistics systems. In the early days, I also delved into hardware programming, which was a fascinating experience.

### Stance on AI
AI is an amazing innovation that should be used for the better. This doesn't mean, generate all code with AI. AI should assist a developer and help them normalize code, or help with a conversation to further learn about how something works. AI should never be used to blindly generate work, the user of AI should always check the AI's work and learn from it, then adapt the solution to whatever is needed. If you don't know how your code works, you can't guarantee the safety of your users.

### Hobbies/Interests
- Game Development (learning projects)
- Grand Strategy Games
