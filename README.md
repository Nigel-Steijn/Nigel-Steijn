# Welcome to my profile!

My name is Nigel, I am a software engineer and started playing with code in 2012. In 2018 at 18 years old I started my professional carreer in programming!

I am mostly a Rust engineer with roots in Java and C++. 

## Activity

I work on creating low level library code and web platforms in mostly Closed Source Software, and work on a company account for my day job (meaning that activity is not shared here).

## My Job

In my day job I work in DevOps Engineering and varied Software Engineering is languages such as: Rustlang (main), Groovy, Java, Python.

I work on containerizing software and optimizing software to run in Kubernetes clusters.

## Tools

I use the following tools:

- RustRover (Editor of choice)
- YouTrack (Issue and time tracking)
- GitHub (Personal projects / code storage)
- GitLab (Professional projects)
- GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD
- Hetzner Cloud (Server Hosting)

## Experience

I started programming at the age of 12 in 2012 and began my professional journey in 2018. Over the years, 
I've primarily worked on closed-source projects, focusing on office automation, logistics and financial systems. 
In the early days, I also delved into hardware programming, which was a fascinating experience and I'd love to improve myself further with.

## LLM

I have opted-out on LLM supported functionalities by default, as I found the architectural decisions made by modern agents and large-langugage models are not great. Changes look great on a per-diff basis, but over the span of an application's life-cycle it hurts the quality to not understand the code thouroughly. I can use LLM's to enhance my workflows, but prefer to program by memory and search for documentation using search-enabled LLMs.

I prefer to not have paths or approaches suggested to me before I thought critically about what I truly need or would benefit the platform most.

## Hobbies/Interests
- Grand Strategy Games
- Remaking dependencies (to learn and improve)
- D&D & Cartography
